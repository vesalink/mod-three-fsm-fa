# Modulus 3 of binary representation of integer using FSM

Consider a string of ones and zeros representing an unsigned binary integer. This is implementation a modulo-three function that will compute the remainder when the represented value is divided by three using [Finite State Machine (FSM)]

## Building and running unit tests

1. `npm run build`
2. `npm run test:unit`
